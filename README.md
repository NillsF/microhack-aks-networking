For this Microhack, we're allowing you to build your own adventure. There's a number of AKS networking scenarios that have been prepared for you. Pick a scenario to walk through and learn more about this networking concept:

1. Ingress and HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
2. Private Cluster
3. NSGs, ILB and AKS

To work with this hack, clone the github repository in Cloud Shell.
